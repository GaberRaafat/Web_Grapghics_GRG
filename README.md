AEC Vision - Architectural Viewer & Editor

AEC Vision is a browser-based 2D/3D viewer and editor for architectural walls, powered by Three.js and TypeScript. The tool enables users to create, view, and manage architectural wall layouts interactively.
🚀 Features
✅ 2D/3D View Switching

    Seamlessly toggle between a 2D orthographic layout and a fully textured 3D perspective scene.

🧱 Wall Drawing Tool

    Draw walls interactively in 2D.
    Walls appear as textured 3D boxes in 3D mode.
    Continuous wall drawing (polygon style) is supported.
    ESC or double-click to end drawing mode.

📐 Wall Properties

    Each wall has metadata:
        Start and end points (x, y)
        Length
        Angle (in radians)

    A live-updating list displays all wall properties.

🔍 Zoom to Fit

    Automatically centers and scales the camera view to fit all walls.

✨ 3D Realism

    Walls are textured using a brick material.
    Lighting setup includes directional and ambient light for realistic shading.

🛠 Tech Stack

    TypeScript for structure and safety
    Three.js for WebGL-based 2D/3D rendering
    OrbitControls for camera interaction
    HTML/CSS for UI

🧑‍💻 How to Use

    Start the app (ensure a local server is running for Three.js texture loading).

    Use the toolbar to:
        Toggle 2D/3D mode
        Enable/disable wall drawing
        Zoom to fit

    In 2D mode:
        Click to place points.
        Click multiple times to create a wall chain.
        Double-click or press ESC to end the drawing session.

    Hover or right-click walls to highlight/select.
